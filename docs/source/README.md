# Source Documents

This folder contains the editable `.pages` files used to build EMSTrainer study guides, prompts, and training materials.

---

## 📘 What Belongs Here

Only clean, finalized `.pages` documents that are:

- Converted from `.docx` (if originally imported)
- Edited and ready for use in the project
- Versioned and named clearly (e.g. `EMS_Trainer_v1.6.0_MasterPrompt.pages`)

---

## 🧼 Naming Convention

Use consistent, descriptive filenames:

    EMS_Trainer_v<version>_<title>.pages

Examples:

- `EMS_Trainer_v1.6.0_MasterPrompt.pages`
- `EMS_Trainer_v1.6.0_QuickStartGuide.pages`

Avoid spaces and special characters — use underscores `_` to separate words.

---

## 🧪 Editing Guidelines

- Use Apple Pages for editing and saving
- Keep formatting clean and consistent
- Include version number in the filename
- Save companion PDFs to `assets/` if needed

---

## 🧭 Versioning

Each `.pages` file should correspond to a specific version of the project. If you update a document, save it with a new version number and move the old one to `docs/archive/<version>/`.

---

## 🛑 What Not to Include

- Raw `.docx` files (quarantine in `docs/needs-convert/`)
- PDFs (store in `assets/`)
- Temporary or backup files (`.pages~`, `.tmp`, etc.)
