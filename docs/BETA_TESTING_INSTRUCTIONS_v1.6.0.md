**Version:** 1.6.0  
**Testing Period:** TBD  
**Testers:** 5 active beta testers  
**Status:** Ready for testing

---

## What You're Testing

This is a **major architecture overhaul** with significant new features. We need your feedback on:

1. **New modular prompt system** (2 files instead of 1)
2. **GPT-5 requirement** (medical accuracy)
3. **4 difficulty modes** (Easy, Standard, Hard, Monica)
4. **Scene safety features** (continuous assessment, unsafe starts)
5. **Equipment failures** (IV, monitor, O2, airway)
6. **Enhanced debriefs** (timing analysis, partner timeline)

---

## Prerequisites

### Required:
- âœ… **GPT-5 enabled** in Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT
  - Open settings and manually enable GPT-5
  - **DO NOT use GPT-4o mini or earlier** (medical inaccuracy risk)
- âœ… Access to testing package (provided by instructor)

### Helpful:
- Keyboard for typing (mobile on-screen keyboard is limiting)
- Recent test results (PlatinumPlanner, practice exams)
- List of topics you're studying

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Extract Package
1. Extract `EMSTrainer_Student_v1.6.0.zip`
2. You'll have:
   - `EMSTrainer_Core.txt` (16k - Foundation + Test/Study)
   - `EMSTrainer_Scenario_Mode.txt` (23k - Scenarios)
   - `Student_Quick_Start_Guide.md` (Reference)
   - `scenario_cardiac_arrest_vf.json` (Example)
   - `README.md` (Overview)

### Step 2: Load into GPT-5

3. Note timing, partner interactions, vitals changes
4. Review comprehensive debrief

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… Realistic difficulty
- âœ… Timing graded in debrief (but no in-scenario penalties)
- âœ… Partner responds to orders appropriately
- âœ… Vitals respond to interventions

---

### Test 5: Hard Mode Scenario

- âœ… Environmental distractions present
- âœ… Equipment failures may occur
- âœ… Timing violations have consequences

---

### Test 6: Monica Mode (Optional - Only if Confident!)
**Goal:** Test extreme difficulty

**WARNING:** This is intentionally brutal. Not recommended unless you want to be humbled!

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… Timer visible and counts down
- âœ… Curveball occurs around 8-9 minute mark
- âœ… Multiple stressors at once
- âœ… Very challenging but fair

---

### Test 7: Scene Safety Feature

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… Scene may start unsafe (requires staging)
- âœ… Scene may deteriorate during scenario
- âœ… Student must recognize and respond
- âœ… Graded on continuous assessment

---

### Test 8: Equipment Failures

**Steps:**
1. Run multiple Standard or Hard scenarios
2. Watch for equipment failures:
   - IV access fails (vein blows)
   - Monitor issues
   - Oxygen equipment
   - Airway equipment

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… Failures feel realistic (not excessive)
- âœ… Student can adapt (backup equipment, alternate routes)
