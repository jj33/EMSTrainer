# Code Blackout - Student Brief

**Scenario Type:** Monica (Extreme Difficulty)

## What Is Code Blackout?

Code Blackout is the ultimate paramedic challenge - a 60-minute cascading medical emergency that tests every aspect of your clinical knowledge, decision-making, resource management, and adaptability. This is Monica-level difficulty, which means:

- **No mercy** - Multiple simultaneous life threats
- **Limited resources** - Equipment failures and constraints
- **Complete isolation** - No backup, no help coming
- **Medical realism** - Consequences based on your actions
- **Time pressure** - Every second counts

**This scenario can be passed, but only with excellent clinical judgment and execution.**

## What You'll Face

### The Call
- **Dispatch:** "Lift assist, 58-year-old male fell"
- **Time:** 03:17 (middle of the night)
- **Location:** Rural residence
- **Seems routine...** until you arrive

### The Reality
This is NOT a lift assist. You'll encounter:

**Medical Challenges:**
- Critical multi-system emergency
- Agonal respirations requiring immediate airway management
- Severe hypoglycemia (glucometer reads "Low")
- Symptomatic bradycardia
- Hypothermia
- High probability of cardiac arrest if poorly managed


### Monitor Battery
- **20 minutes remaining** (wasn't charged during last shift)
- Must manage strategically - turn on/off to conserve
- After inverter surge at loading, monitor AC input is destroyed (battery only)

### IV Pumps
- **Only ONE pump works** - you must choose which drug gets it
- Common choices: D10 continuous drip, or pressors

### LUCAS Device
- **45 minutes of battery** - plenty of time
- Deploy if arrest occurs
- The one piece of equipment that works perfectly!

## Key Skills Tested

1. **Airway Management** - Agonal respirations require immediate action
2. **Glucose Crisis** - "Low" reading = critical, D10 vs D50 decision
3. **Cardiac Management** - Symptomatic bradycardia, possible arrest
4. **Family Communication** - Use AIDET or wife will interfere
5. **Resource Management** - Limited O2, battery, supplies
6. **Equipment Troubleshooting** - Adapt when monitor damaged
7. **Transport Timing** - Load-and-go vs stay-and-play decision
8. **Solo Management** - Cody drives, you're alone in back

## Tips for Success

### Critical Actions
- **Airway first** - Agonal respirations = immediate BVM/intubation
- **Check glucose immediately** - "Low" is life-threatening
- **Use D10, not D50** - D10 provides sustained correction
- **RECHECK glucose at 15-20 minutes** - D50 will crash, D10 needs monitoring
- **Start pacing for bradycardia** - Don't wait

### Communication
- **Use AIDET with wife in first 2 minutes** - Prevents interference
- **Give Cody clear, specific orders** - He's brand new, needs direction
- **Ask Cody for monitor readings** - "What's showing on the monitor?"

### Resource Management
- **Conserve O2** - You will run out if using CPAP continuously
- **Manage monitor battery** - Turn on for checks, off to save power
- **Choose pump drug wisely** - Only have one working pump
- **Don't waste time on scene** - >30 minutes = penalties

### Timing
- **Every minute matters** - Delays compound into major penalties
- **Recheck glucose** - Forgetting this causes arrest
- **Transport before 30 minutes** - Critical patients need hospital

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Ignoring wife (she will physically interfere)  
❌ Forgetting to recheck glucose (patient arrests from rebound)  
❌ Delaying airway management (hypoxic arrest)  
❌ Staying on scene too long (>30 minutes)  
❌ Wasting monitor battery leaving it on  
❌ Using CPAP without considering O2 supply  
❌ Not directing Cody clearly (he needs specific orders)

## Grading Overview

**Total: 1000 points**
- Critical Actions: 300 points
- Clinical Decision Making: 250 points  
- Technical Skills: 200 points
- Communication & Leadership: 150 points
- Documentation & Handoff: 50 points
- Hidden Criteria: 50 points

**Timing penalties are significant throughout**

**700+ points = Pass**

## Resources to Review

- AIDET communication framework
- D10 vs D50 for severe hypoglycemia
- Bradycardia treatment algorithms (pacing vs atropine)
- LUCAS deployment procedure
- Post-arrest care
- Resource conservation strategies

## Final Words

Code Blackout is designed to be extremely challenging but **always winnable**. There is always a path to success if you:
- Recognize and prioritize correctly
- Communicate effectively
- Manage resources wisely
- Adapt when things fail
- Keep moving forward under pressure

**Good luck. You'll need it.**
