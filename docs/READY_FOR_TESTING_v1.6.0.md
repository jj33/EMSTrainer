## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Instructor Testing (Today)

**Load Prompts:**
1. Open GPT-5 in Copilot/ChatGPT
2. Drag `prompts/EMSTrainer_Core.txt`
3. Drag `prompts/EMSTrainer_Instructor_Prompt.txt`
4. Drag `prompts/EMSTrainer_Scenario_Mode.txt`

**Test: Question Generation**
```
"Generate 10 test questions on cardiac rhythms for paramedic students"
```
✅ Verify: Questions generated with answer key and explanations

**Test: Study Guide**
```
"Create study guide on BLS airway management for EMT students"
```
✅ Verify: Complete study material with examples and practice questions

**Test: Scenario Creation**
```
"Create a respiratory distress scenario for AEMT students, Standard difficulty"
```
✅ Verify: Complete JSON scenario generated

**Test: Grading**
```
"Grade this submission: [paste examples/student_submission_example.json]"
```
✅ Verify: Scored rubric, feedback, timing analysis

---

### Phase 2: Student Testing (Next)

**Load Prompts:**
1. Open GPT-5 in Copilot/ChatGPT
2. Drag `prompts/EMSTrainer_Core.txt`
3. Optional: Drag `prompts/EMSTrainer_Scenario_Mode.txt` for scenarios

**Test: Practice Questions**
```
"I'm weak in Cardiology (65%) and Respiratory (70%). Generate practice questions."
```
✅ Verify: Targeted questions in weak areas with explanations

**Test: Study Mode**
```
"I need help understanding ACLS protocols"
```
✅ Verify: Study guide generated with teaching approach

**Test: Easy Scenario**
```
"Run a respiratory distress scenario in Easy mode"
```
✅ Verify: Supportive, no penalties, hints provided

**Test: Standard Scenario**
```
"Run a cardiac arrest scenario in Standard mode"
```
✅ Verify: Realistic timing, graded debrief, NREMT-level

**Test: Hard Scenario (Advanced Students Only)**
```
"Run a trauma scenario in Hard mode"
```
✅ Verify: Strict timing, equipment failures possible, challenging

**Test: Monica Mode (Experienced Only)**
```
"Run a [type] scenario in Monica Mode"
```
⚠️ Verify: Timer countdown, maximum difficulty, brutal feedback

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

**Full Workflow:**
1. Instructor creates scenario
2. Deploys to student (email format)
3. Student runs scenario in GPT-5
4. Student saves/submits results
5. Instructor grades submission
6. Instructor reviews class summary

**Expected Issues:**
- Submission format questions (need to clarify save process)
- Hash validation (how to implement in chat-based system)
- Dynamic elements tracking (scenario varies per student)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical
1. **Hash validation** - Theoretical, not fully implemented in chat
2. **File saving** - Students must manually save conversation/actions
3. **Submission format** - Need to define clear format for copy/paste
4. **Tool call limits** - Cursor Agent Mode has 25 tool limit (workaround: smaller chunks)

### Workflow
1. **Grading submissions** - Currently requires student to format their actions
2. **Batch operations** - No batch processing (one student at a time)
3. **LMS integration** - None (future)

### Documentation
1. **Mobile keyboard** - Documented but not ideal experience
2. **File management** - No central storage system (local files only)

## 📋 Feedback Needed

### From Instructors:
1. Is test generation useful and accurate?
2. Are study guides appropriate level?
3. Is scenario creation intuitive?
4. Can you grade submissions effectively?
5. Are summaries actionable?

### From Students:
1. Are practice questions helpful?
2. Do study guides match learning needs?
3. Are scenarios realistic?
4. Is difficulty scaling appropriate?
5. Are debriefs educational?

### From Everyone:
1. Is GPT-5 requirement clear?
2. Are Quick Start guides sufficient?
3. What's missing or confusing?
4. What features are most valuable?
5. What should we prioritize next?

## 🚀 Next Steps (Based on Testing)

### Immediate Priorities:
1. Clarify submission format for students
2. Test all difficulty modes with real students
3. Validate grading accuracy
4. Collect feedback from all 5 testers

### Short-term (v1.6.1):
- Fix any critical bugs found
- Improve documentation based on feedback
- Add missing examples if needed

### Medium-term (v1.7):
- Equipment timing delays (LUCAS, EtCO2)
- Custom rubric creation
- Advanced grading system
- In-prompt scenario editor
- First Responders multi-agency

### Long-term (v2.0):
- Full encryption
- Web dashboard
- LMS integration
- Batch operations (Python tools)

## 📞 Support & Communication

### For Testing Team:
- Report issues in GitHub or direct to Joel
- Share feedback early and often
- Test realistic use cases (not just happy path)
- Document workarounds you discover

### For Joel:
- Session notes in `docs/SESSION_NOTES_2025-01-06.md`
- Load that file when starting new chat tomorrow
- All planning tracked in `planning/` folder
- Ready for your next session!
