# EMSTrainer Scenario Debrief — Class Summary
## Scenario Summary
**Scenario ID:** cardiac_vf_001
**Title:** Cardiac Arrest — Ventricular Fibrillation
**Provider Level:** Paramedic
**Difficulty:** Standard
**Date Range:** 2025-10-07
**Students:** 30

## Overall Performance
- **Average Score:** 70.0/100
- **Pass Rate (≥70):** 56.7%
- **Grade Distribution:** A:8 B:4 C:5 D:13

## Category Breakdown (avg / max)
- Defibrillation ≤2 min: 12.0/20
- CPR quality: 12.0/15
- Epinephrine timing: 8.0/10
- Airway management: 11.2/15
- Rhythm checks: 10.0/10
- Post-ROSC care: 7.3/15
- Documentation: 9.4/15

## Common Strengths
- Rhythm checks at proper 2-min intervals — 30/30 students
- Excellent early defibrillation — 18/30 students
- Appropriate epi timing within 5 minutes — 18/30 students
- Timely, effective airway management — 11/30 students
- Complete post-ROSC bundle prior to transport — 8/30 students

## Common Challenges
- Reduce hands-off time during shock and airway transitions — 30/30 students
- Documentation thin; follow SOAP with times/interventions — 24/30 students
- Deliver first shock within 2 minutes of arrival — 12/30 students
- Airway management deficiencies; practice two-person BVM and confirmation steps — 12/30 students
- Prepare and execute post-ROSC care once perfusion returns — 12/30 students

## Teaching Recommendations (Instructor Cody)
- Run a 10-minute pit-crew CPR drill emphasizing compressor swaps and minimizing hands-off time (target ≤10s around shocks).
- Medication timing station: pre-load 1 mg epi in a mock code within 3–4 minutes using closed-loop verification of dose and route.
- Airway lab: two-person BVM with ETCO₂ inline capnography; progress to rapid SGA placement in ≤60s when intubation is delayed.
- Rhythm-cadence metronome: use a 2-minute timer that prompts rhythm checks synchronized with compressor switches.
- Post-ROSC bundle checklist practice: oxygen titration, 12-lead within 2 minutes of ROSC, fluids/pressors per protocol, and early destination decision.
- Documentation sprint: SOAP note template with times and interventions; aim for 250–350+ characters across O/A/P sections.
