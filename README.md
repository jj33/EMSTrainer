## Overview

EMSTrainer is an AI-powered EMS training system with three modes: **Scenario Practice**, **Test Questions**, and **Study Guides**. Designed for both students and instructors, it provides realistic training scenarios with automatic grading and detailed feedback.

### Two-Part System
- **👨‍🎓 Student Side:** Practice scenarios, generate study materials, receive immediate feedback
- **👨‍🏫 Instructor Side:** Create scenarios, generate tests/study guides, deploy to students, auto-grade submissions

---

## ⚠️ Requirements

### GPT-5 Required
**EMSTrainer requires GPT-5** for medical accuracy and clinical reasoning.

- **Available in:** Microsoft Copilot (free tier) or ChatGPT Plus
- **How to enable:** Open settings in Copilot/ChatGPT and manually enable GPT-5
- **DO NOT use:** GPT-4 or earlier models (insufficient medical knowledge)

### Device Recommendations
- **Best:** Laptop or desktop computer
- **Mobile:** Bluetooth keyboard strongly recommended
- **Voice input:** Works but less precise for medical terminology

## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

### Provider Scope Customization
Create `assets/provider_levels.json` to override default scope by jurisdiction:

```json
{
  "EMT": {
    "can_perform": ["IV", "IO", "12-lead", "limited_medications"],
    "cannot_perform": ["advanced_airway", "RSI"]
  }
}
```

See `examples/provider_levels_expanded_emt.json` for a complete example.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
Run validation scripts to check test data integrity:
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_test_results.py
```

### Regression Baseline
The v1.6.1 release includes a 30-student stress test baseline in `tests/baseline/`.

See `tests/TEST_PLAN.md` and `tests/README_TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` for details.
