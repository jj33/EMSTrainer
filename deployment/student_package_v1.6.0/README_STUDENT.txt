HOW TO ENABLE GPT-5
================================================================================

GPT-5 IS REQUIRED - Do not skip this step!

IN GITHUB COPILOT:
  1. Open Copilot chat window
  2. Look for the model selector (usually shows "GPT-4" or similar)
  3. Click it and select "GPT-5" or "o1" 
  4. Verify it says "GPT-5" or "o1" before proceeding

IN CHATGPT (Web/App):
  1. Open ChatGPT
  2. Click your profile icon (bottom left)
  3. Settings → Model → Select "GPT-5" or "o1"
  4. Close settings

WHY GPT-5?
  - Medical accuracy and knowledge depth
  - GPT-4 and earlier models make clinical errors
  - Required for realistic scenarios and grading

IF YOU DON'T HAVE GPT-5:
  - Ask your instructor for access
  - Some schools provide free access
  - ChatGPT Plus includes GPT-5 ($20/month)
  - GitHub Copilot may include it (check your plan)

================================================================================
HOW TO DRAG AND DROP FILES
================================================================================

STEP-BY-STEP:

1. OPEN THE CHAT:
   - Open GitHub Copilot chat panel (in VS Code or browser)
   - Or open ChatGPT in your browser

2. LOCATE THE FILE:
   - Unzip this package on your computer
   - Find the file: EMSTrainer_Core.txt

3. DRAG THE FILE:
   - Click and HOLD the file with your mouse
   - Drag it over the chat window
   - You'll see a highlight or "Drop file here" message
   - Release the mouse button

4. WAIT FOR UPLOAD:
   - File uploads (takes 1-2 seconds)
   - You'll see "Uploaded: EMSTrainer_Core.txt" or similar

5. REPEAT:
   - Do the same for EMSTrainer_Scenario_Mode.txt
   - Then for your scenario file from instructor

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Can't drag? Try: Copy file contents, paste into chat, say "This is the prompt"
- File too large? Email instructor - shouldn't happen with our files
- Wrong file type? Files should be .txt or .json

After you complete a scenario, the AI will give you a JSON file to submit.

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:

  - Contains your scores, actions, and vitals
  - Looks like: {"student_id": "Your Name", "scenario_id": ...}

HOW TO SAVE IT:

1. CLICK "COPY" BUTTON
   - Look for Copy button at top-right of the code block
   - Or manually select all the JSON and copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)

2. OPEN TEXT EDITOR:
   - Mac: TextEdit (in Applications)
   - Windows: Notepad (Start → Notepad)

3. PASTE THE JSON:
   - Paste what you copied (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)

4. SAVE AS .JSON FILE:
   Mac:
     - File → Save
     - Name it: scenario_cardiac_JohnSmith_2025-01-07.json
     - Make sure it ends in .json
   
   Windows:
     - File → Save As
     - Change "Save as type" dropdown to "All Files"
     - Name it: scenario_cardiac_JohnSmith_2025-01-07.json
     - Click Save

5. EMAIL TO INSTRUCTOR:

   - Send!

CAN'T SAVE FILE?
  - Take a screenshot of the JSON as backup
  - Or copy/paste the entire JSON into the email body
