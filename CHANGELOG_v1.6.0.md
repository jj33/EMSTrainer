- **AIDET Communication** (10 pts): Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, Thank you
- **Scene Safety Reassessment** (15 pts): Continuous throughout

### Enhanced Debrief Format
- Timing analysis (target vs actual vs hard max)
- Timestamped action log with partner interactions
- Hidden criteria scores revealed
- Difficulty-specific feedback
- Markdown source + PDF output
- Standardized filename: `[Date]_[ScenarioID]_Debrief_[StudentID].md`

### Vitals Trending by Difficulty
